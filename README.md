# aim2dat

aim2dat (Automated Ab-Initio Materials Modeling and Data Analysis Toolkit) is a library for pre-, post-processing and data management of ab-initio high-throughput workflows for computational materials science.
For further details and documentation, please visit www.aim2dat.github.io/aim2dat.

## Feature List

* Managing and analysing sets of crystals and molecules.
* Ab-initio high-throughput calculations based on aiida.
* Plotting material's properties such as electronic band structures, projected density of states or phase diagrams.
* Interface to machine learning routines via sci-kit learn.
* Function analysis: discretizing and comparing 2-dimensional functions.
* Parsers for the DFT codes CP2K, FHI-Aims and QuantumESPRESSO as well as phonopy and critic2.

## Installation

```sh
pip install aim2dat
```

Further details can be found in the documentation (www.aim2dat.github.io/aim2dat/installation.html).
